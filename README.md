# Description: 
The objective of this project is to enhance the website's conversion rate on smaller screens by introducing a toggle feature. This feature dynamically shortens the description content, presenting a concise overview by default. Users have the flexibility to toggle between the brief and full descriptions, with the goal of boosting visibility for Call To Action (CTA) sections and motivating users to book a tour.
